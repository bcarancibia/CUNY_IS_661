The Timor-Leste Secretary of State for Security and PNTL have requested New Zealand assistance in the area of community policing. Community policing features centrally in the 2009 PNTL Organic Law, and both political and police leaders have prioritised community policing as an appropriate approach to reduce conflict and crime in Timor-Leste, underpinning economic and social development. The overall goal of the TLCPP is to build safe and secure communities, through effective and efficient community policing in Timor-Leste. The programme comprises three components: 1) A strategic component, focused at the national level, providing support for PNTL to further develop and institutionalise its community policing policy, strategy, action plans, systems and procedures, and mechanisms for engagement with community stakeholders, and to develop special programmes on key community policing issues in consultation with districts. This will involve an NZ Police long-term Advisor providing support to PNTL, particularly the Community Policing Unit and NZ Police short-term technical assistance in areas of particular need such as Police Intelligence Services and development of programmes on key community policing issues such as prevention of domestic violence. 2) A training component to support effective recruit and in-service community policing training (among all PNTL staff) which will not only develop knowledge and skills in community policing, but also the motivation, confidence and commitment to implement such an approach. This will involve an NZ Police Training Advisor providing support to the Police Training Centre and Community Policing Unit for the development of appropriate training materials and development and implementation of effective training programmes. At the commencement of the programme there will be an opportunity for PNTL managers at both national and district levels who are involved in the programme to visit New Zealand for comparative study purposes and to begin programme planning with their NZ Police counterparts. 3) An operational component in the districts focused on providing support for PNTL District Commanders and staff to institutionalise effective community policing systems and procedures and to deliver effective community policing at district, sub district and village levels. This will involve NZ Police Mentors working in 3-4 districts. The Mentors will visit 3-4 times a year to a maximum of 12 weeks and be available for contact in between visits to the extent that this is practicable. The Community Policing and Training Advisors will also have a role in supporting District Managers in between visits by Mentors.",Timor-Leste Community Policing Programme,31/07/2016,15/07/2011,31/07/2016,,Timor-Leste, ," - Aileu - Baucau - Bobonaro - Liquica - Manatuto", ,"New Zealand Aid Programme, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade",150 - GOVERNMENT AND CIVIL SOCIETY,"-- 152 - Conflict prevention and resolution, peace and security",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,49541.146,0,52655.333,11557037.72,18777.226,0,94553.706,0,726863.672,0,1882671.887,0,1366978.863,0,1080823.333,0,1787796.548,0,1274318.239,0,0,0,1397001.499,0,0,0,139700.149,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11557037.72,3949957.457,0,5921724.149  87292538314,"Demonstration of maize planting, training for the Timorese agricultural technicians on maize planting technology and affording seeds","Three-party cooperation on agriculture between China, US & Timor-Leste",30/10/2014,01/10/2013,30/10/2014,01/10/2013,Timor-Leste, , , ,The People's Republic of China,311 - AGRICULTURE,-- 3119 - Agriculture (Sub-sector),0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,212407.888,50000,0,0,0,160000,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,212407.888,210000,0,0  87292497563, ,The Project for Establishment of Fisheries Training Center in Liquica District,,,,,Timor-Leste, ,Liquica, ,Korean International Cooperation Agency,313 - FISHING,-- 3139 - Fishing (Sub-sector),0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,251647.657,251647.657,1500000,0,0,0,1500000,0,0,0,1500000,0,0,0,1500000,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,251647.657,251647.657,6000000,0  87292481500,"The purpose of the Head of Mission Fund is to enable New Zealand Posts, consistent with their diplomacy objectives, to flexibly support activities which manifestly and directly meet development needs in recipient countries.

(ii) An analysis of the past trends in total health expenditures (particularly government and development partner financed) and of planned health expenditures over the medium term including documentation of aid expenditures by key inputs and areas of focus. This would establish the likely resource envelop available to the health sector from both Government and development partners including the demands for counterpart financing by development partners. It would also document the incremental recurrent costs arising from development expenditures (government and development partner financed) and accruing to the recurrent budget over the medium term. (iii) An analysis of the likely (increased) demand for pharmaceuticals and medical supplies required by the health system as a result of both new service policy initiatives and the dramatically increased supply of doctors.

In particular, support is required to: i) help systematically assess natural hazard risks that its assets and livelihoods are exposed to, ii) enable risk-informed planning with the involvement of the affected communities, and iii) minimize the losses that result to infrastructure assets and livelihoods by taking an approach to disaster risk management that combines both ex-ante and ex-post activities and also both structural (engineered) and non-structural solutions.

There have been some significant increases of total enrollment in basic education and government expenditure.

Among others: There is a large access gap between urban and rural areas; learning outcomes of Timorese students remain a serious concern; a majority of teacher is of below the required qualification (in addition to high absenteeism rates, high proportion of voluntary teachers, and a major teacher retirement looming). In addition, the country is also challenged to have a skilled workforce available to help drive productivity and economic growth over the coming decade. To provide a more comprehensive evidence to the Government of Timor Leste to develop and implement policies which will lead to improved access and learning for children and youth, four additional activities will be implemented: 1.

In large part this will be attempted through presentations to the MoF's Consultative Council on Finance Management, MoF's technical working group on social protection, the directors and the Minister of MSS, the inter-ministerial pensions working group. Also includes technical support to the NSO for the revision of the national household survey questionnaire to create capacity for empirically driven SP policy decision-making. Component 2: Bolsa da Mae reform The second component of the proposed AAA aims to improve performance and efficiency of Bolsa da Mae CCT (BdM) program. Discussions with the MSS have identified specific interest for TA in (1) assessing the adequacy of the BdM benefit structure, and (2) on assessing the effectiveness of verification mechanisms for CCT compliance. The two notes will rely on desk review of international practice, review of operational manuals, field visits to interview beneficiaries/social animators and analysis of the 2011 household income and expenditure survey. The MSS also requested a diagnostic report for improving operational processes of the Bolsa da Mae program. The resulting assessment(s) are expected to become the core input in designing a comprehensive reform action plan by the MSS. The task aims to develop a partnership with the UNDP which will involve coordinating over the TORs for the UNDP and World Bank consultants undertaking the review, consulting over the emerging findings and policy messages and potentially jointly releasing a single study or a set of coordinated reports. Finally, the MSS is looking for assistance to develop community sessions for promoting good parenting practices among BdM program beneficiaries. To this end the team is proposing to partner with the UNICEF who will be responsible for delivering the background study of current needs, mapping of existing programs and a proposal for educational content with the operational framework. The Bank SP team which has a comparative advantage over the Bolsa da Mae will provide continuous feedback to the UNICEF consultants to ensure that the study is relevant and the resulting proposal can interface with the operational systems of the Bolsa da Mae program. Component 3: Pensions As per the advice provided by the World Bank during the previous FY the Ministry of Finance would like to repeal and replace the civil service pension law as it deems it too broad in scope, coverage and cost. To that end, the Ministry of Finance had requested assistance to provide detailed feedback on major articles of the pension law, focusing on what this law does, how it might be amended and the attendant financial implications of the amendment. The Ministry of Finance also requested for a policy paper that reviews international experience in dealing with multiple objectives, namely: civil servants retirement, severance options and integration with national social security plan.

Part 2 will undertake a detailed review of the institutions for planning, budgeting and implementing infrastructure projects, including efficiency of procurement. And Part 3 will examine sector infrastructure activities in more detail including budgets, and the management and outputs of selected projects in the areas of roads, irrigation and electricity supply, including life-cycle costs. The analysis of the electricity sector will concentrate on likely future recurrent costs and cost recovery. Outputs will include a series of policy notes with recommendations on the link between public spending, growth and fiscal sustainability in Timor-Leste (Part 1), institutional strengthening to improve this link (Part 2), and ways to achieve cheaper and better outputs in roads, irrigation and electricity sub-sectors, including procurement and life-cycle costs (Part 3). Analysis, recommendations, and written outputs in Parts 1 and 2 will be informed by sector specific evidence and findings in Part 3, requiring some sector work to proceed simultaneously with work on parts 1 and 2.

It is a recent amalgamation of twelve different codes and, as such, lacks consistently and clarity. In some cases, practices are not WTO compliant or contribute to inefficient goods processing. In addition to revisions to the Custom code, IFC will review and make recommendations to improve the General Quarantine Regulations which sets the foundation for procedures, practical rules and general requirements on the sanitary control of import and export goods. Up to seven related regulations will be reviewed and amendments recommended as appropriate. Work on legal and regulatory reform is necessary to set the foundation for process reform. Current laws and policies, while functional, are a cause of delay. Providing clarity and transparency, and deliberately articulating priorities with in the laws, will be the first step to addressing the necessary process reengineering component. 2) Support Customs and Quarantine with Process Reengineering: Reforming law is necessary, but not, sufficient to achieve proposed project impact. IFC will help Customs and Quarantine to apply the legal changes, propose and support improved process efficiencies. The introduction and application of risk management to import and export clearance will be a key part of the process reengineering work. Risk management is not performed now but its application to goods and import agents will help improve efficiencies. Related to risk management, options for application of pre-clearance processes will be examined. The project will also provide DGC and DoQ with technical advice related to a potential upgrade of its trade system. The Project will provide help train Customs and Quarantine officials and private sector users in regard to the new processes and develop necessary manuals and guidelines to support the implementation of the reform. 3) Stakeholder Outreach and Development: During project pre-implementation, IFC helped form the National Customs Brokers Association (ASDATIL). IFC will continue to support the association by helping it validate and advocate for policy reform and through training to its members to help improve private sector compliance with reformed laws and regulations. As the Association is new, IFC will also advise the association's leadership on effective management techniques and good practice to encourage sustainable operations and practices. This will include simple and basic advice on stakeholder communication, record keeping, governance, fundraising, meeting management, etc. IFC will help support the newly formed National Trade Consultative Forum (NTCF) -- a multi-government agency initiative to identify and promote good trade practice across different government offices and departments. The NTCF will be an important vehicle to work on trade regulation advocacy and enforcement across government departments, including the National Trade Facilitation Committee, and other development partners, e.g. ADB and its support for National Single Window (NSW).

It has worked with all the key institutions: the Courts, Prosecution, Public Defenders, the Ministry of Justice (including the corrections component) and the Legal Training Centre. Building on the positive results achieved to date, the new project phase (JSP Phase IV) will systematize and improve mechanisms for policy-making, coordination, and strategic planning. This means more focus on consultative law-making practices, improved planning, management and administration, with a more evidence-based approach. This will be complemented by introducing a new ""district pilot"" approach where innovative solutions for improving the management and access to justice can be tested. This ""district pilot"" approach will target interventions that can contribute to better administration of criminal justice between agencies and stakeholders such as the District Prosecutor's Office, National Police (PNTL) and local communities. On the demand side, innovative approaches will be tested to increasing peoples' awareness of, and ability to access their rights. With a particular focus on the most vulnerable populations, successfully demonstrated innovations and lessons will inform national planning and policy making for wider application scale up or institutionalization. After 10 years of supporting delivery of front-line justice services in the country JSP will now need to develop and implement an exit strategy for internationals performing line functions, with a view to start substantial reductions as early as 2015.

R4D is designed for 4 years. However, as significant capacity issues exist within key stakeholders and partners, full achievement of the objective of R4D may require an 8-years time horizon. R4D is designed to become the leading nation-wide program in the rural roads sub-sector in Timor-Leste, covering all the 13 districts of the country. R4D's main thrust is to develop and institutionalize adequate capacities and instruments in the public sector - in particular within the Directorate of Roads, Bridges and Flood Control (DRBFC) of the Ministry of Public Works (MOP) - and among local contractors, that will enable GoTL to effectively and equitably plan, budget and implement investments in rural road construction, rehabilitation and maintenance. A holistic capacity building strategy will be followed that will focus on strengthening capacities in the public sector and among local contractors. This will be done by supporting MOP/DRBFC in establishing functional management and technical capacities and operational tools, by providing capacity development support to local contractors, in supporting policy/strategy dialogue and development, by providing leading coordination support and by supporting the development of a performance culture and knowledge management capability.

The project activities will start with the identification of priority rural roads to be rehabilitated in the 1st year. An estimated 50 km would be contracted through competitive tendering amongst local Contractors who have demonstrateable experience in the field of labour-based rural works. As other Contractors will be trained by the project they will be entrusted with the rehabilitation of specific short sections of rural roads and eventually participate in competitive tendering processes. The target for the 2nd year would be another 50 km (at the minimum) to be rehabilitated plus the routine maintenance of the earlier completed 50 km. In the 3rd year, another 50km (at the minimum) would be rehabilitated plus routine maintenance of the 100 km completed in the preceding two years.

Against this backdrop, real need / market-oriented strategies and instruments have to be put in place and the main partners involved in the process of private sector development must operate in an integrated and coordinated manner. The BOSS Project is supporting the Institute for Business Support (IADE) of the Secretary of State for the Promotion and Support of the Private Sector and other relevant stakeholders, to deliver need/market-oriented services to Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) and contractors, develop value chains in selected sectors, promote better coordination and alignment of private sector initiatives and contribute to a ""private sector- sound"" development. The Project strategy is based on a systemic approach toenterprise development that addresses a range of needs and challenges of Timorese MSEs. In particular, the Project intends to tackle some of the main problems and constraints identified by the Timorese entrepreneurs: lack of dialogue and coordination between the public and the private sectors; lack of market access for products and services, ineffective utilization of local resources / opportunities, limited involvement of private sector in Government service delivery and weak managerial and entrepreneurial knowledge. Moreover, the Project will ensure that the needs of women entrepreneurs are better catered for and ensure a gender sensitive approach in private sector development. The BOSS Project is a private sector development project incorporating institutional strengthening of its partners. It acts as a facilitator, focusing on technical assistance, coordination, networking, and information. During the five years of implementation, the BOSS Project supports IADE in boosting local economic development, enhancing Government service delivery and creating quality employment in rural areas by expanding market access for MSEs, strengthening local contractors and improving the provision of business development services. The BOSS Project supports the Government of Timor-Leste in achieving key targets set as part of its Strategic Development Plan, which aims at establishing the private sector as the primary source of growth in incomes and employment in rural areas. The Project is well coordinated with all other private sector development initiatives in Timor-Leste and cooperates with a range of partners and development organisations to foster synergies. The BOSS Projects integrates gender equality at all levels. Due to its embedded implementation methodology the Project enjoys a high degree of local ownership. The Project focuses on sustainability and scale, which means striving for both systemic change and developing a clear vision of the future beyond the Project lifespan. The BOSS Project has a facilitative rather than an interventionist role. Acting as a ""catalyst for change"" encourages more players to take part in the market systems (i.e. crowding in), and lead to greater local ownership and more relevant and sustainable change and impact. Interventions facilitated by the Project aim to address the prior identifi ed underlying causes of market underperformance. The Project has three main components: Objective 1: Increased business opportunities for MSEs in target sectors and districts Objective 2: Nation-wide access to enhanced and innovative market / need orientated business development services Objective 3: Increased SEAPRI commitment and capacity to mainstream gender in all policies, programs and activities The Development Objective of the Project is to contribute directly to the generation of pro-poor economic development and quality employment for women and men and indirectly to peace consolidation and conflict prevention.",BOSS -

Furthermore, climate change projections indicate that these trends are likely to intensify in the future, increasing the frequency and severity of climate-induced disasters, such as floods and landslides. These disasters are likely to put road infrastructure and community assets at increased risk and as a consequence the vulnerability of communities will increase. The Dili to Ainaro Road Development Corridor (DARDC) comprises a joint investment by the Government of Timor-Leste and the World Bank to upgrade and strengthen the climate resilience of the road infrastructure linking Dili to the capitals of Aileu and Ainaro Districts. The problem that the proposed LDCF project seeks to address is that climate change is expected to increase damage to road infrastructure in the DARDC resulting from an increased intensity of climate-induced disasters. Damage to road infrastructure is expensive to repair and restricts: i) economic development; ii) market access; iii) access to services such as education and health care; iv) evacuation during natural disasters; and v) provision of disaster relief. Furthermore, this threat of damage to road infrastructure is exacerbated by ecosystem degradation resulting from existing land-use practices. Such ecosystem degradation increases the risk of floods and landslides owing to reduced water infiltration and increased soil erosion.","Strengthening Community Resilience to Climate-induced disasters in the Dili to Ainaro Road Development Corridor, Timor-Leste.(DARDC-00090905)",,01/09/2014,,,Timor-Leste, , , ,Global Environment Facility Trust Fund,400 - MULTISECTOR/CROSS-CUTTING,-- 410 - General environmental protection,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,70560,70561,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,70560,70561,0  87292381482,"The overall objective of the project is to develop national Disaster Risk Management (DRM) capacity at the national and district levels, including in communities vulnerable to natural disasters and climate change.

In 2013, USAID's All Children Reading has reached the following remarkable milestones: 1) Completion of the first-year training for 31 primary school teachers to improve their teaching methods and skills. Participants were equipped with skills to enhance children's and young reader's interest in reading. In addition, the teachers developed curriculums to go back and train more people in their institutions using the knowledge and resources they received in the training. 2) Production of literacy resource kits which include children's books, flashcards, and motivational pictures, in Tetun, for use in classrooms. The resource kits are distributed to all districts through participants in ACR's training. 3) Training of teachers in formulating strategies to encourage children's teamwork and social skills.

It is bordered on the west by the Indonesian province of Nusa Tenggara Timur. 500km south across the Timor Sea is Australia. Timor-Leste is jurisdictionally divided into 13 districts and 65 sub-districts. Empowerment entails not only acquiring rights and control but also securing sustainable livelihoods and inclusive service delivery, which is the focus of this proposal. This proposal seeks to mobilize communities to achieve their own empowerment whilst simultaneously equipping them with the skills and tools to improve their own food security, education, sanitation and hygiene, and child and maternal health. The COMPASIS project is proposed to be implemented in two of the poorest districts of Timor-Leste; Ermera and Oecusse. Women farmers, war widows, unemployed youth, returning internally displaced persons (IDPs), children, and food insecure people will be especially targeted as project beneficiaries. Timor-Leste was declared independent from Portugal on 28 November 1975 and was invaded and occupied by Indonesian forces nine days later. It was incorporated into Indonesia in July 1976 as the province of Timor Timur (East Timor). An unsuccessful campaign of pacification followed over the next two decades, during which an estimated 100,000 to 250,000 individuals lost their lives. On 30 August 1999, in an UN-supervised popular referendum, an overwhelming majority of the people of Timor-Leste voted for independence from Indonesia. Between the referendum and the arrival of a multinational peacekeeping force in late September 1999, anti-independence Timorese militias commenced a large-scale, scorched-earth campaign of retribution. The majority of the country's infrastructure, including houses, irrigation systems, water supply systems, and schools, and nearly 100% of the country's electrical grid were destroyed. On 20 September 1999, the Australian-led peacekeeping troops of the International Force for East Timor (INTERFET) were deployed to the country and brought the violence to an end. On 20 May 2002, Timor-Leste was internationally recognized as an independent state, and became a Member of the United Nations on 27 September 2002. In April and May 2006, long simmering grievances on the part of a group within the Defense Forces of Timor-Leste (F-FDTL) gave rise to public demonstrations and eventually resulted in open conflict between factions of the F-FDTL, the Policia Nacional de Timor-Leste (PNTL) and armed civilians. By the time order was restored, the national leadership of the PNTL had collapsed, and other State institutions were in disarray. Fighting between the army and the police resulted in the massive displacement of people, deaths, and large-scale damage and destruction of houses, commercial properties and infrastructure. As a result of this crisis, the government fell and the international community was requested to provide assistance. In the immediate aftermath of the crisis, it was largely acknowledged that the limited access of young Timorese to productive job and targeted training opportunities has been one of the major causes of the deep frustration that led to the violence. This is a reflection of the accumulation of political and socio-economic factors still drawing civil society into a vicious cycle of poverty and social exclusion that has the potential to prolong social tensions and create continued involvement of unemployed youth in criminal activities. In August 2006, the UN Security Council established the UN Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT), which included an authorized police presence of over 1,600 personnel. The International Stabilisation Force (ISF) and UNMIT restored stability, allowing the Government of Timor-Leste to hold presidential and parliamentary elections in April and June 2007 in a largely peaceful atmosphere. However, armed attacks on the President and the Prime Minister in February 2008 further underscored the fragility of state institutions. Timor-Leste is one of the 50 countries designated by the United Nations as ""least developed countries"" (LDCs). Timor-Leste's domestic economy is based on subsistence agriculture on which over 75% of the population depends. Ermera district is located in the west-central part of the country. It has a population of 103,199 (Census 2004) and an area of 746 km2. Its capital is Gleno, which is located 30 km to the southwest of the national capital, Dili. Ermera is one of only two land-locked districts in Timor-Leste. Oecusse is an enclave district of Timor-Leste within West Timor Indonesia. Oecusse is reachable by road and is at a minimum 80km from the border of Timor-Leste and Indonesia. Oecusse covers an area of 815 km2, and has a population of 57,469 (Census 2004). The COMPASIS project seeks to protect extremely poor households (with a major focus on women farmers, war widows, unemployed youth, returning IDPs, children, and food insecure people) in the aforementioned districts of Ermera and Oecusse. The COMPASIS project aims to protect these beneficiaries against threats of civil strife, poverty, hunger, poor health, illiteracy and social exclusion so that they are empowered to realize their fundamental rights and full human potential.",Community Mobilization for Poverty Alleviation and Social Inclusion in Service Delivery (COMPASIS) 00074165,31/08/2013,01/03/2010,31/08/2013,01/03/2010,Timor-Leste, ," -

It has worked with all the key institutions: the Courts, Prosecution, Public Defenders, the Ministry of Justice (including the corrections component) and the Legal Training Centre. Building on the positive results achieved to date, the new project phase (JSP Phase IV) will systematize and improve mechanisms for policy-making, coordination, and strategic planning. This means more focus on consultative law-making practices, improved planning, management and administration, with a more evidence-based approach. This will be complemented by introducing a new district pilot approach where innovative solutions for improving the management and access to justice can be tested. This district pilot approach will target interventions that can contribute to better administration of criminal justice between agencies and stakeholders such as the District Prosecutor's Office, National Police (PNTL) and local communities. On the demand side, innovative approaches will be tested to increasing peoples' awareness of, and ability to access their rights. With a particular focus on the most vulnerable populations, successfully demonstrated innovations and lessons will inform national planning and policy making for wider application scale up or institutionalization. After 10 years of supporting delivery of front-line justice services in the country JSP will now need to develop and implement an exit strategy for internationals performing line functions, with a view to start substantial reductions as early as 2015. The exit strategy will be based on an assessment of resource needs and an agreed, detailed plan on how the institutions will fill them.

There have been some significant increases of total enrollment in basic education and government expenditure. School grants have led to the abolition of school fees, and infrastructural improvements have increased access opportunities. However, there are still many challenges. Among others: There is a large access gap between urban and rural areas; learning outcomes of Timorese students remain a serious concern; a majority of teacher is of below the required qualification (in addition to high absenteeism rates, high proportion of voluntary teachers, and a major teacher retirement looming). In addition, the country is also challenged to have a skilled workforce available to help drive productivity and economic growth over the coming decade. To provide a more comprehensive evidence to the Government of Timor Leste to develop and implement policies which will lead to improved access and learning for children and youth, four additional activities will be implemented: 1.

The National Education Strategic Plan could be said to represent 'best practice' in education strategic planning in a fragile state context. The National Education Strategic Plan offers a vision for education and seeks to achieve universal basic education completion by 2030, gender equity in access and management by 2015, and elimination of illiteracy among 15-24 year olds by 2015. Timor-Leste has made great progress in restoring basic education services to its people, and education has received significantly increased resources over the last decade. Total enrollment in basic and secondary education has increased between 2002 and 2011 by 14.6 percent. The number of teachers more than doubled during the same period. There have been significant improvements in school infrastructure and facilities, as well as progress in central government management and institutional capacity. The introduction of the Basic School cluster-based reform provided the opportunity for a major shift in accountability and autonomy at the school level. It also supports schools to address major service delivery constraints through their own strengthened community-based management. For instance, the reformed School Feeding program shifts the focus of program solutions from central to sub-national levels, in which communities can start playing an important role. School grants have led to the abolition of school fees and have supported school-based management reforms and increased school autonomy. At the same time, a new teacher career regime was approved due the need to introduce qualification and competency standards linked to career progression, salary increases and teacher accountability. Although government has focused on and invested in access to education, there are still large access gaps, particularly between urban and rural areas. Student absenteeism is also a major cause for concern. Key driving factors are related to inadequate school infrastructure and facilities, affordability of education and few opportunities for non-formal and second chances education programs. In addition, poor learning outcomes of Timorese students is a major area of weakness. Results from a early grade reading assessment conducted in 2011 show that in Grade 1, only 3 percent of students attained a basic oral reading fluency benchmark (45 correct words per minute (CW). Among Grade 2 students, only 14 percent of students were able to read at that level. While system performance is discouraging, the assessment also showed that success is possible: at the end of Grade 3, 61 percent of students are able to read at the benchmark. Results from Early Grade Mathematics Assessment conducted in 2011 reveal that math problems involving reasoning presented difficulties to around 77 percent of Grade 2 and 62 percent of Grade 3 students. Only about a third of students in Grade 1 could solve simple additions. In general, poor learning results are associated mainly to teachers' low qualifications, high proportion of voluntary teachers, high levels of teacher absenteeism, lack of pre-service teachers training of teachers, major teacher retirement looming and lack of textbooks and learning materials. High repetition rates, especially among early graders, low reading ability and difficulties with simple math reasoning problems remain very problematic. Improvement of quality of education in Timor Leste requires a series of efforts including ensuring that comprehensive sets of policies enabling such improvement to happen. The Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER) has been used as a tool evaluate the quality of education policies against evidence-based global standards, using new diagnostic tools and detailed policy data collected for the initiative. In addition to SABER analysis in 4 dimensions, teacher policy, school autonomy and accountability, student assessment and workforce development carried out in 2012-2013, SABER analysis on ECD and Engaging Private Sector (EPS) will be used to more comprehensively support the effort to improve quality of education in Timor Leste. Research has proven the importance of investing in ECD. Children who participate in well-conceived ECD programs tend to be more successful in later school, are more competent socially and emotionally, and show higher verbal and intellectual development during early childhood than children who are not enrolled in high quality programs. However, ECD presents a particular challenge to policymakers due to its multi-sectoral nature and the need to reach out to a variety of stakeholders. SABER-ECD will provide policymakers in Timor Leste with tools and analysis to identify policy reforms that can promote healthy and robust development for all children during their early years. Partnership with private sector in education can maximize the potential for expanding equitable access to schooling and for improving education outcomes, especially for marginalized groups. This is an important policy area in Timor Leste. While basic education remains a public responsibility, the government can explore and use a variety of models for financing and providing high-quality education services that promote equity goals. SABER-Engaging Private Sector will provides guidance on how to ensure that the work of non-state providers helps meet national education goals Reliable evidence is needed to design policies that will allow overcoming Timor-Leste's remaining challenges in provision of quality education. Accordingly, the first school survey was conducted in Timor-Leste in 2012. The second school survey is planned for 2015 to inform the policy makers about changes have been in place at school level and further efforts/reforms needed to improve service delivery. Education system will ultimately be demanded to contribute to productivity. Study on Skills Toward Employment and Productivity (STEP) will inform the policy makers on the skills constraints inhibiting the supply of the skills demanded by the labor market.",P150515/TF017149: Improving the Quality of Education,,,30/09/2016,,Timor-Leste, , , ,Government of Australia,110 - EDUCATION,"-- 111 - Education, level unspecified",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200000,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200000,0  87292377386,"Activity aims to: (1) to influence policy debate over appropriateness and adequacy of the current social protection policy, (2) to support development of the Bolsa da Mae CCT program and (3) inform and influence parametric and structural design of the civil service and national pension schemes. The activity is outlined as follows (for further details see supplemental information): Component 1: Dialogue over the social protection policy This component will focus on communicating the broader needs for social protection reform, namely, to (1) respond to vast exclusion of majority of poor from the safety nets (2) to enhance promotional value of social assistance. In large part this will be attempted through presentations to the MoF's Consultative Council on Finance Management, MoF's technical working group on social protection, the directors and the Minister of MSS, the inter-ministerial pensions working group. Also includes technical support to the NSO for the revision of the national household survey questionnaire to create capacity for empirically driven SP policy decision-making. Component 2: Bolsa da Mae reform The second component of the proposed AAA aims to improve performance and efficiency of Bolsa da Mae CCT (BdM) program. Discussions with the MSS have identified specific interest for TA in (1) assessing the adequacy of the BdM benefit structure, and (2) on assessing the effectiveness of verification mechanisms for CCT compliance. The two notes will rely on desk review of international practice, review of operational manuals, field visits to interview beneficiaries/social animators and analysis of the 2011 household income and expenditure survey. The MSS also requested a diagnostic report for improving operational processes of the Bolsa da Mae program. The resulting assessment(s) are expected to become the core input in designing a comprehensive reform action plan by the MSS. The task aims to develop a partnership with the UNDP which will involve coordinating over the TORs for the UNDP and World Bank consultants undertaking the review, consulting over the emerging findings and policy messages and potentially jointly releasing a single study or a set of coordinated reports. Finally, the MSS is looking for assistance to develop community sessions for promoting good parenting practices among BdM program beneficiaries. To this end the team is proposing to partner with the UNICEF who will be responsible for delivering the background study of current needs, mapping of existing programs and a proposal for educational content with the operational framework. The Bank SP team which has a comparative advantage over the Bolsa da Mae will provide continuous feedback to the UNICEF consultants to ensure that the study is relevant and the resulting proposal can interface with the operational systems of the Bolsa da Mae program. Component 3: Pensions As per the advice provided by the World Bank during the previous FY the Ministry of Finance would like to repeal and replace the civil service pension law as it deems it too broad in scope, coverage and cost. To that end, the Ministry of Finance had requested assistance to provide detailed feedback on major articles of the pension law, focusing on what this law does, how it might be amended and the attendant financial implications of the amendment. The Ministry of Finance also requested for a policy paper that reviews international experience in dealing with multiple objectives, namely: civil servants retirement, severance options and integration with national social security plan. This task will also include just-in-time advisory services to the MoF and the MSS on the emerging national social security scheme.",P147353/BB: Dialogue and TA for improved social protection policy,,,15/05/2015,04/02/2014,Timor-Leste, , , ,Government of Australia,160 - OTHER SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES,-- 1609 - Other social infrastructure and services (Sub-Sector),0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,109539,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,109539,0,0  87292377354,"The current activity will help the authorities from the Ministry of Finance design a debt management reform plan, building on results from previous technical assistance reports.

Climatologists project that the weather in the region is likely to become hotter and drier, leading to drought and causing rainfall to become heavier and erratic, causing more flooding. The low-lying atolls within the region are also highly susceptible to climate change phenomena such as sea level rise, coastal erosion and coral bleaching. There is now substantial evidence to indicate that the changes in weather conditions associated with climate change will increase the likelihood and intensity of recurrent natural disasters throughout the country. The country experiences cyclical effects of the El Nio/Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-related weather anomalies. Floods have resulted in decreased agricultural production, damage to infrastructure, and particularly in heavy flood-affected locations, displacement of communities and loss of property and livelihoods. In cases of flooding, watershed behaviour is associated with disasters affecting lives and livelihoods. The combination of heavy monsoonal rains and steep topography make many parts of the country prone to floods, landslides and river shifts. Prevalent deforestation leading to erosion compounds the likelihood of landslides and builds up sediment in the rivers exacerbating river shifting and flooding. Poor road design and drainage also worsens flooding and landslides. Although casualties have not been of high proportion in the rainy season, severe disruption to road networks cuts off community access to markets and contributes to food insecurity. The levels of disaster risk are compounded by poverty, socio-economic and environmental imbalances. Practicalities such as either rugged terrain or remoteness also leave many disaster-prone communities isolated from resources and assistance. In addition, low levels of development in Timor Leste, multiply the disaster risk faced by this nation thereby eroding the gains of existing poverty reduction programmes, which challenges it in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDG). Evidently, past disasters have led to water and food security issues, health concerns, as well, impeded hard-won development gains. In spite of these impacts and hazard-prone nature of the affected communities, formalized disaster risk reduction (DRR) initiatives have yet to be effectively fostered at national and sub-national levels. While there have in recent past been certain level of engagement of international actors, such as AusAID and UNDP working at the national level in Timor-Leste, there has also been some dynamic agencies, with the appropriate knowledge and expertise, working in partnership with local governments and NGOs at the grassroots level. While some at-risk communities, particularly those in more isolated settlements, pursue informal disaster management activities of a traditional and indigenous nature, this local knowledge is not being appropriately harnessed and community vulnerability to disasters is still present. In sum, there is a general lack of understanding and awareness of natural hazards, climate change and disaster preparedness and adaptation within the communities ?",Disaster Risk Reduction through Building Community Resilience in Timor-Leste - CS.0426,14/12/2013,15/06/2012,,,Timor-Leste," - Lauana - Soba"," - Baucau - Bobonaro - Dili - Ermera - Lautem - Manatuto"," - Baucau - Bobonaro - Hatolia - Laclubar - Laga - Lautem - Lete Foho - Luro - Soibada - Venilale - Vera Cruz",United States Agency for International Development,700 - HUMANITARIAN AID,-- 720 - Emergency Response,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,518738,77441,0,0,0,444896,0,441297,900000,0,0,360000,0,0,0,540000,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1418738,522337,0,1341297  87292191148,"Expenses related to the management of AusAID programs.

MCFC works with the National Directorate for Fisheries and Aquaculture in the Ministry of Agriculture (MAF) to support aquaculture development in Liquica, Dili, Manatuto, Baucau, Lautem and Manufahi Districts. MCFC provides technical assistance and training assistance in mud crab and fish cultivation to coastal communities living adjacent to mangrove areas. The project additionally develops small-scale aquaculture business through producer groups. Technical and training support is directed at producer groups who demonstrate a strong interest and desire to diversify their source of revenue and invest in aquaculture as a livelihood. The program further links producers to domestic markets, and work with buyers, traders and producer groups to develop business linkages. The project is using a value chain approach with public and private sector partners to build aquaculture enterprise and trade through high value products and increase new income opportunities for rural households. Aquaculture Approach: MCFC organizes the producer groups within each location to start-up mud crab production by fattening crabs or growing out and selling to local markets where there is a growing market demand. Other assistance includes sourcing wild crabs, feeding and construction of cages, pens and grow out pond systems, using mostly local materials. Crab producers are taught that mud crabs should be fattened to between 600 and 800 grams of body weight. Mud crabs are sold locally to supermarkets and tourist-oriented restaurants and hotels Hatchery: To ensure the long-term sustainability of crab farming and fishing activities, the MCFC project intends to build a small-scale hatchery in collaboration with MAF in order to produce and hatch seed stock for viable crab production.

The 2007 elections were the first national post-independence elections organized by the Timorese and as such represent an important step in the consolidation of democracy in the country. The elections were administered by the Technical Secretariat for Electoral Administration (STAE) and supervised by the National Electoral Commission (CNE). The three national electoral processes, Presidential (2 rounds) and Parliamentarian, were considered in general by the stakeholders to have been free, fair and in line with international standards and national laws. The national electoral bodies were assisted by technical assistance made available by this project and the United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT). Based on the lessons learned throughout this demanding process and in view of the need to strengthen the human and institutional capacity of the national electoral management bodies, political parties and the media, this project has been revised for its second phase to provide longer-term support following the 2007 national elections and using an Electoral Cycle Approach. The second phase of the project will work with the electoral institutions (CNE and STAE) and the political parties to build capacities, and will work on issues of legal reform and civic education to ensure open and participative electoral processes. In so doing, the project aims to establish a framework for international assistance for the Timorese electoral cycle, coordinate international donor support, target funds and services more effectively and avoid duplication of resources. Where the focus of the first phase of the project was on 'hard' or material assistance, the focus of the second phase is on 'soft' or human capacity and institution building assistance.

To address the IDP issues and more broadly early recovery challenges in a comprehensive and coordinated manner, the Government of Timor-Leste adopted the National Recovery Strategy (NRS) in December 2007. While a range of initiatives to support the NRS are underway, there is still a significant gap in promoting early recovery and durable solutions to the IDP population. With the current progress achieved on the return and reintegration, of IDPs and the gradual decommissioning of camps, these solutions have become the more essential for insuring sustainable returns and mitigating any risk of conflict in already strained communities.

The availability and dissemination of labour market information is a fundamental element to allow effective and efficient organization of the employment services, promote the smooth functioning of the labour market and stimulate development. This is the background against which the Timor-Leste Labour Market Information System (LMI) Project was designed. It aims to build the capacity of the SEFOPE to provide IT and Management Information Systems support to the National Directorate of Employment and National Directorate of Vocational Training, and labour market information to the Government of Timor-Leste and other stakeholders as required. The present initiative builds on the outputs of the LMI Systems Project funded by the Irish Aid since December 2006, of which the assistance was central to establish a Labour Market Information Department within SEFOPE and to create an embryonic national capacity in such a specific and technically demanding area. Since its inception, the LMI Systems Project has been representing a resources centre that provides crucial support services to other employment creation and skills development initiatives implemented under the organizational framework of the SEFOPE, contributing decisively to the improvement of their outreach and impact. It enables SEFOPE to take informed decisions on the new directions for the Timor-Leste Vocational Training System, on the measures to stimulate closer articulation with employers, to improve job mediation, to promote self-employment, livelihoods and temporary employment, and to establish Career Guidance services. Just taking as reference the period starting from January 2008, the programmes assisted by the LMI Project provided Career Guidance to 13,731 clients (51.9% women and 74.1% youth) of the Employment and Career Guidance Centres (CEOPs), approved 99 community proposals in all the 13 districts of Timor-Leste creating training and self-employment opportunities for 3,469 women (77.6%) and men job and training seekers, and generated 1,827,795 workerdays of employment that provided 58,305 workers (27% women and 48.3% youth) in rural areas with temporary jobs and income. Despite the remarkable progress achieved, SEFOPE still requires further assistance to overcome some remaining issues such as the need to improve the articulation between information customers and producers, improve the quality of the data, enhance the use of existing sources of LMI and address critical data gaps. The current 18-months extension of the LMI Project will allow to complete the development and installation of the new SIMU Web (SEFOPE computerized Labour Market Information system) in the 5 Employment and Career Guidance Centres of the districts of Baucau, Bobonaro, Dili, Ermera and Oecusse, and to finalise and release the findings of the first post-independence Timor-Leste Labour Force Survey.

The Government's response, the National Recovery Strategy, included the provision of compensa-tion for damage and destruction to houses and goods, known as the HHU programme. This was divided into two phases; Phase I awarded payments of up to USD 4,500 based on the level of house destruction, while a further 500 USD was given to claimants who lost goods during the crisis, known as Phase II. While it was envisaged that HHU would close in the early months of 2010, by July 2010, there remained a residual caseload of around 300 cases pending process and payment under Phase I. Moreover, the Government requested that MSS process an additional 5,000 cases of families who had allegedly missed the original registration, but had approached the Govern-ment through local authorities, other government institutions, and the Church. During the budget rectification in June and July 2010, the National Parliament approved an additional USD 4.1 million for MSS to complete the programme and any issues relating to the 2006 and 2007 crises by the end of 2010. This deadline was set by the National Parliament, as condition to approving the additional budget as above mentioned. Until July 2010, IOM had provided technical support to MSS and HHU, facilitating the payment of recovery packages1 for 16,478 families and the closure of 65 IDP camps. IOM provision of technical support was crucial to establish administrative systems, to increase understanding of the different components of the programme, and to deliver technically based un-biased recommendations and advice on the challenges faced during the programme's implementation. Therefore, to facilitate the smooth workflow of cases necessary to meet the National Parlia-ment's deadline, and based on IOM's previous support to the implementation of HHU, MSS requested IOM's continued support and presence at MSS. This request gave rise to various challenges, not least of which was the short timeframe to register, verify and process the additional cases by the end of the year. MSS also highlighted concerns that a faster process of cases without additional support could potentially increase potential for abuse of the system, and required support to take complete control of the admin-istrative systems and procedures accompanying HHU. To this end, IOM provided support to: the core evaluation process whereby family claims were registered, verified and, if appropri-ate, provided with recovery packages; to differentiate between valid and fraudulent claims; and to conduct capacity building to ensure national ownership and sustainability of the admin-istrative procedures.","Building houses together"" program TL10 DP.0530",01/02/2011,01/10/2010,,,Timor-Leste, ,Dili, ,International Organization for Migration,160 - OTHER SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES,-- 1609 - Other social infrastructure and services (Sub-Sector),0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100000,55110,0,55110,0,44891,0,44890,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100000,100001,0,100000  87292431577,The objective of the study is to define areas of intervention and to assess the relevance and feasibility of the relevant actions.,Appraisal study to define programmes/projects under 10th EDF for Sustainable Rural Development in the Democratic Republic Timor-Leste,18/07/2010,18/01/2010,,,Timor-Leste, , , ,European Union,400 - MULTISECTOR/CROSS-CUTTING, ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,499886.389,499886.389,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,499886.389,499886.389,0,0  87292191294,"To be provided to the Secretary of State for Culture to finance the repair of uma lulik or sacred houses around the country.

Programs at each school will share a common standardized core agribusiness curriculum. In addition, each school will have an associated operating agribusiness that will be used as a training tool for the students. The type of business and technical emphasis at each school is as follows:  At Fuiloro, Land O'Lakes will build on the school's existing capacity in dairy production to develop a small but sustainable value-added dairy products business. Training will be provided to faculty and students in market research, dairy processing and sales. Initial strategy will focus on import substitution within the Dili dairy products market, targeting retail and institutional buyers.  At Natarbora, Land O'Lakes will develop an apiculture (beekeeping and honey production) business at the school and use this as a working model to train students in agribusiness management and market development. Marketing efforts will focus on Dili area supermarkets and shops.  At Maliana, Land O'Lakes will develop a horticultural business that focuses on producing irrigated high value fruits and vegetables for the Dili market. This is a small-scale business, but can incorporate all of the elements of a commercial enterprise, and can act as a teaching model. As a foundation to the above activities, Land O'Lakes will develop a standardized core agribusiness curriculum at the three schools with emphasis on developing skills in bookkeeping, management, agribusiness financial modeling, marketing, credit, business law/regulations and ethics. Agribusiness skills will be further refined by the use of agribusiness case studies and comprehensive agribusiness plans prepared by the students prior to graduation. The combination of exposure to actual business operations (through the dairy, apiculture and horticulture businesses at the schools), along with research and study of operating businesses will prepare graduates to become proficient technicians, entry-level managers and entrepreneurs within East Timor's agricultural sector. The activity plan assumes that every year, 50 students from each school will graduate from the one year (comprised of four quarters of instruction) agribusiness certificate program. Total output of all three schools will be 150 students per year, beginning 18 months after program start-up. The total investment by USAID will be $3,000,000 USD. Assuming that the investment in curriculum and school-agribusiness development is amortized over a ten-year period (and 1,500 graduates), the cost per program graduate will be approximately $2,000 USD. Additionally, the activity will train approximately 30 faculty members in a variety of agribusiness subjects.",Building Agribusiness Capacity in East Timor,01/09/2011,01/10/2006,,,Timor-Leste, ," - Bobonaro - Lautem - Manatuto"," - Barique - Lospalos - Maliana",United States Agency for International Development,400 - MULTISECTOR/CROSS-CUTTING, ,0,0,0,0,6000000,2000000,0,0,0,1000000,0,0,0,1800000,0,0,0,500000,0,0,0,700000,0,700000,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6000000,6000000,0,700000  87292511675,"This is a regional program to promote wo This is a regional program to promote the gender sensitive women's participation in politics at regional, national and local level in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Philippines, East Timor and Vietnam.

During this project's implementation, IOM will design specific training curricula, which will provide a deeper understanding of human trafficking, including concepts and definitions, and practical activity-based guidelines on how to address and manage counter-human trafficking activities across the key areas of prevention, protection and prosecution. Based on these curricula, IOM will organise seven 5-day training workshops. Participants will be drawn from MSS Headquarters and districts including those in the department of child protection, and civil society organisations' staff already working in shelters, namely PRADET. Apart from these specific training sessions, IOM will conduct onsite mentoring activities as required to both trained MSS and civil society staff including in the districts. In addition to enhancing the knowledge and capacity of participants on trafficking and how to concretely undertake counter trafficking activities, the project will launch a survey on irregular migration, including irregular entry, trafficking in persons and smuggling of migrants in Timor-Leste.

The outstanding problems are as follows: _ Women and girls are still vulnerable to violence and internal conflict, particularly in relation to gender-based violence and human trafficking. Existing lacunas in the legislative framework and service delivery have had a detrimental effect on women and girl's security and well-being. _ Little to no social services is in place to respond to victims of violence, exploitation and abuse, including women and girls, especially in rural areas. _ Women and girls are still discriminated against in the areas of health, education and economic development with government services and opportunities not responding appropriately to their needs and with little allocation of resources to guarantee this. _ Women and girls from female-headed households in poverty-stricken districts and trafficking-prone areas are less likely to benefit from traditional forms of social safety nets, thus increasing their vulnerability. _ Lack of sex-disaggregated data in all sectors remains a major problem. The proposed Joint Programme (JP) ""Supporting Gender Equality and Women's Rights in Timor-Leste"" is a three-year programme that supports the GoTL to improve the conditions of women and girls in Timor-Leste through the protection of their rights and their empowerment. It offers them fair access to social and economic resources by increasing their access to entitlements and rights. The JP has been developed and will be implemented by five UN agencies in partnership with government agencies and structures at national and district levels and in collaboration with relevant civil society organisations and individuals to build institutional capacity to address the above problems. The JP will support an environment to establish legal frameworks to end domestic violence and human trafficking by enabling women and girls to claim their rights. These legal frameworks establish norms, standards and practices for the GoTL to operationalise programmes i.e. services, outreach mechanisms, social protection scheme to reduce vulnerability of women and girls as well as improving protection for them. The JP also focuses on budget as an influential policy instrument of the government to ensure government's financial commitment to programmes that will impact on the lives of women and girls. This is in line with the current priorities of the GoTL in social protection and solidarity by improving social service delivery though national planning of the budget and execution for performance and accountability.",Supporting Gender Equality - Timor Leste CT.0334,31/08/2012,01/12/2008,,,Timor-Leste, , , ,International Organization for Migration,400 - MULTISECTOR/CROSS-CUTTING, ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1283716,0,0,0,0,0,0,920000,0,916229,0,0,0,320063,0,321000,0,47424,0,42716,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1283716,1283716,0,1283716  87292511671,"Improved technical skills in agricutural and fisheries production with gender equity, improved organizational skills with gender equity, improved the quality and variety of production, improved the marketing of products.","Poverty alleviation with the improvement of economic abilities, especially of women, supporting micro business and productive development.",01/12/2011,01/05/2006,,,Timor-Leste, ," - Baucau - Viqueque", ,Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation,400 - MULTISECTOR/CROSS-CUTTING, ,0,0,0,0,675000,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,69961,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,675000,0,0,69961  87292491885, ,Mobilize Social Business to Accelerate Achievement of MDGs,,01/03/2012,28/02/2015,,Timor-Leste, , , ,Korean International Cooperation Agency,400 - MULTISECTOR/CROSS-CUTTING, ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  87292491518,Sending Timorese to Korea and Training Getting expierince from Korea Sharing Knowledge and making community with paticipants from other contries,Invitation Training in Korea (Area: Energy Cooperation),,01/04/2010,,,Timor-Leste, , , ,Korean International Cooperation Agency,700 - HUMANITARIAN AID, ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4000,4000,0,4000,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4000,4000,0,4000  87292191290,Funded to Department of Justice's Resident Legal Advisor (RLA) office supported development of the criminal justice sector.,Resident Legal Adviser,30/06/2010,01/06/2009,,,Timor-Leste, , , ,United States Agency for International Development,150 - GOVERNMENT AND CIVIL SOCIETY, ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3160000,1100000,0,0,0,740000,0,740000,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3160000,1840000,0,740000  872921011786,Gender mainstreamed in sectors.

The project comprised three components: to build and rehabilitate community infrastructures; to produce and disseminate a best practice house construction manual; and, to produce an educational soap opera. In communities strongly affected by the 2006 crisis, the project provided assistance to the government with the construction and rehabilitation of small-scale community infrastructures to mitigate potential conflicts caused by competition for resources. These small-scale infrastructures were built in four high-risk sucos (villages), in Dili, and were selected through IDP Return Monitoring findings carried out by IOM, in consultation with several partners and the beneficiary communities. In Timor-Leste most families build their own houses, often without the necessary technical skills. The production of a housing manual aimed to provide user-friendly, safe and healthy house construction advice to support primarily returning IDPs who build or re-build their houses. In order to initiate a process of national reflection on a variety of social issues linked to the 2006 crisis, the project produced and arranged for the broadcasting of an educational soap opera (telenovela) on both radio and television.

The new WFP Country Programme supports the national MCHN programme led by the Ministry of Health's Nutrition Department by focusing on preventing chronic under-nutrition during the window of opportunity from pregnancy to 23 months and on treating moderate acute malnutrition among children 24-59 months and PLW, through health facilities. The aim is to reach about 100,000 beneficiaries, to be targeted gradually until 2013. Each beneficiary receives at the health facilities a monthly take-home ration of fortified blended food (Timor Vita or imported CSB+ & oil). This service is expected to be provided by the staff Ministry of Health at the health centres and health posts, but since they are many times overloaded with the implementation of more than ten different programmes, volunteers from the community support facilitate in the handling and storage of food. They receive the food, provide appropriate storage conditions for the food received and facilitate in its distribution and recording. With support of WFP the storage facilities are being improved, but the majority are still very poor and still many health facilities don't have any, they rely on the neighbours good-will. The condition of the buildings/structures is very weak so a lot of attention has to be paid to the food storage. Food distribution in most cases takes place at the facility level. However, since many beneficiaries can't reach the health centre or health post very often due to the distance, road conditions, lack of transport, services timetable, work, etc, SISCa is being used as an important site to screen for the programme and to distribute food. In order to sustain this activity at SISCa level, a person needs to join the team to keep the food, and do the proper distribution to beneficiaries identified by the health staff.

This will be achieved by increasing awareness and support for the MDGs amongst policy makers and government workers and by increasing engagement with and appreciation of the MDGs amongst Timorese families. It is expected that these efforts will lead to further prioritization of the MDGs in national strategies, plans and budgets at the national level and to greater involvement by civil society groups and citizens in shaping the national MDG agenda. Since the Initiative commenced, it has also focused on supporting both of MDG-F Joint Programmes - the Joint Programme on Gender Equality and Women's Rights and the Joint Programme on Nutrition and Food Security - thus ensuring an integrated approach to the implementation of all the MDG-F supported activities in Timor-Leste.",MDG-F Focus Country Initiative on Advocacy and Communication,,01/09/2010,31/12/2012,01/02/2010,Timor-Leste, , , ,Government of Spain,400 - MULTISECTOR/CROSS-CUTTING,-- 430 - Other multisector,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,210000,67182,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,210000,67182,0,0  872921031896,"The principal objectives of the MDG-F Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Initiative in Timor-Leste are to support the implementation of the two joint programmes and to develop MDG monitoring and evaluation (M&E) capacities at national and district levels.

The training will address the challenges of limited knowledge and skills of government officials with the focus on assessing progress towards the MDGs, including data collection and analysis, and how to use data for evidence-based policy development and decision making. The action plan also supports further development of the Timor-Leste DevInfo with the inclusion of MDG indicators in the database as well as training of government officials in the use of DevInfo. The updated DevInfo and the preparation of MDG indicators will be a key tool in the preparation of Timor-Leste's MDG Reports. Overall, the objectives of the MDG M&E Initiative are in line with the UNDAF as well as the National Priorities and the Timor-Leste Strategic Development Plan (2011-2030), thus seeking to strengthen the achievement of the MDGs, implementation of the Paris Declaration, the UN approach of ""Delivering As One"", and other national and international development objectives.
