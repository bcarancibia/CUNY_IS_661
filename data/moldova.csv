In the second quarter, mixed teams of students, mentors and staff representatives will make visits to primary trade union organizations, which have delegated the trainees, in order to become familiar with their situation and discuss with the trade union activists about the existing problems. As a result, trade union issues will be identified and selected within trade union organizations in order to be addressed and resolved through individual or group projects, which, typically, will be presented by the students at the evaluation of the first training year. However, all the projects will be submitted for evaluation to a special committee of experts who will select the best and effective projects and will propose their implementation in the second year. Year II (the period from September to August of the year II) - practical implementation of individual or group projects selected by the special committee of experts and provision of necessary financial and logistical support (based on an estimated budget) in order to implement the projects within the economic unit (the primary trade union organization). In order to have an effective organization of the mentioned activity, we suggest having quarterly meetings expressed in trainings for the participants, mentors and trainers responsible for certain projects, where will be presented/discussed the progress of problems faced by students in the process of project implementation. Simultaneously, at the request of students, will be held separate meetings, which will take the form of consultations given by persons nominated by the participant. Activities in this stage will allow keeping in sight the post-project activities of TUSM participants, will ensure the practical application of theoretical knowledge acquired in the first year of training and will enhance the learner's ability to act. Year II will conclude with an assessment activity, where students, assisted by activists of primary trade union organization (if desired) will present/inform/show the stages of individual or group project achievements, and the final results concerning primary trade union organization, where the project was implemented. Therefore, students participating in the training will have concrete actions (projects) that will have a practical and measurable effect on trade union members, which will result in development of functional, social and professional skills of trade union staff and strengthening primary trade union organizations.",01/08/2014,31/07/2016,Grant,160 - OTHER SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES,0,0,0,0,0,0,94800,0,94800Austria,„Capacity development of VET providers in the Water and Sanitation Sector in Moldova” (AquaProf II),"The proposed intervention will significantly contribute to the improvement of the situation in Water Sanitation Sector (WSS) with focus on human capital development.

While Moldova has a legislative framework allowing for basic child protection during judicial proceedings, reports on actual practices point out repeated incidences of mistreatment, secondary victimization and inadequate access to information for child victims, witnesses and offenders alike. Available data and expert consultations identified the first contact with the justice system as the stage where the highest number of incidents involving discrimination and ill-treatment occur. As such, this action targets the greatest need for support and the most effective point of intervention to achieve real change in the treatment of children in contact with the law. Overall, the action aims to reduce the potential for discrimination and ill-treatment of children during the early stages of contact with the justice system in Moldova. With a strong emphasis on child and civil society participation, this proposed action works in close collaboration with all the key stakeholders to ensure local ownership and sustainability. The action has been developed as a direct request from Terre des hommes (Tdh) and from the Police Inspectorate in Chisinau, to support their capacity building in the area of juvenile justice. It is aligned with and directly feeds into the national reform of child protection system lead by the Ministry of Labour, Social Protection and Family (MLSPF), and into the implementation of the National Police Reform Strategy of 2013. The action will result in a training package for police officers, tested and ready for national roll-out; increased coordination between civil society, child protection authorities and police, along with the availably of supportive tools; and improved access to information for children and parent/care-givers. To meet the overall objective, the action has been designed in three complementary clusters, each serving and directly improving the capacity of one out of three key target groups (police officers; members of Inter-Agency Coordination Mechanism [IACM]; children and parent/care-givers).

The evidence prompt that the tested intervention model is worth being replicated in communities with low social inclusion rates. The new project will be based on the tested intervention models focusing at facilitating formal and non-formal educational processes in three communities with low social inclusion rates (one from center of Moldova - town of Hincesti, one from north - Gribova, rayon of Drochia and one from South - Zirnesti, rayon of Cahul. The action will facilitate Roma kids' integration in the local schools and in society as a whole by providing assistance for better education services (educational vouchers) and for a better study environment.

Taking into account the observations and the feedback received from different partners during the pilot project implemented (2013 year), Ograda Noastra will adjust the format of homework facilitation sessions so that it both fits the individual needs of the kids and also provides a realistic, more financially sustainable model for the Moldovan authorities and other interested actors interested in replicating Ograda Noastra model of integrating vulnerable kids at school. In this sense the format and methodology of the homework facilitation classes will be adjusted accordingly. On the other hand, the project will ensure a strong non-formal education component which will be ensured through Ograda Noastra's Democracy school inclusion program.

The mentioned villages need a serious economic support in order to attract investments, tourists, and not in the last, to avoid the considerable migration out of these places, especially of young persons. In our case, we evidently mean water supply and sanitation systems, because, despite of gas networks built several years ago and roads in rather good condition, the lack of qualitative drinking water and of sewage system creates to dwellers, economic entities a lot of inconveniences and difficulties. The submitted Project proposes to offer solutions for common problems existent in those 3 partner-localities. Keeping in mind the Overall Objective, the Action focuses on a strong cross border impact, including: 1. impact on the life quality and health condition of population from the border regions; 2. impact on environment; 3. economic impact. The problems to be solved directly through the Project reside in the following: Water supply in Stolniceni. There have been found drinking water sources near the village. But the source cannot supply enough water for the centralized system, because the essentially decreased debit in the summer time. Thus, to ensure a stable flow of the water in the centralized water supply system, there was decided to repair two of the three artesian wells from the built-up area of the locality and to equip them correspondingly, to lay the pipes and to connect the businesses, public entities and individual consumers to the built networks. The sewage system in Stolniceni is an obsolete one, being built in 1983. Presently, it can receive the wastewaters only from several social buildings. Also, there is a pipe ( 200 m) and a reception basin, from which the wastewaters are delivered to the treatment station from Hincesti Town. Ghermanesti Locality, Romania, disposes of a network of supplying drinking water on 50 % of streets, the rest of villagers confining to the only alternative - consumption of water from shallow wells. This water doesn't correspond to the drinking requirements, because it is much polluted and poses a major risk for population's health. So, our intent is to extend the existing network with at least 40 % of the length. The dwellers of Utconosivca Village from Ukraine feel themselves deprived because of the long-lasting lack of water supplying networks for drinking or cooking purposes. The sewerage system does not exist. As well as the technical designs for both mentioned systems.

Availability of reliable, up-to-date structural data on the crop and livestock sector will support the national agricultural development strategy and for the effective planning and monitoring for the development of the agriculture sector and for food security for the population.","Agriculture will continue to remain backbone of Moldovan economy. The importance of reliable benchmark information on agricultural structure, thereafter, cannot be overlooked. Availability of reliable data is a prerequisite for preparation of an effective reform process and for monitoring the results of policies. Against this background, the Government recognizes that there is an urgent need to conduct a comprehensive agricultural census and has committed resources for this. The following reasons support the Census of Agriculture in Moldova: Lack of reliable basic data on agricultural structure (agricultural holdings, labour, agricultural land areas, land use, irrigation etc.) which creates major constraints for proper agricultural and rural policy formulation, and evaluation of their outcome and impacts. Lack of up-to-date and reliable agricultural data is also a constraint for adequate policies for reduction of food insecurity and hence, eradication of poverty. The lack of adequate data also handicaps the optimal allocation of national and international resources to agriculture and rural development. Aggregate totals for basic agricultural data derived from the census will be used as benchmarks for validating current agricultural statistics and for deriving inter-census estimates. The census will provide an essential component for an integrated system of agricultural statistics as different types of agricultural sample surveys could be planned using census listing as sampling frame. Data for small administrative units, with adequately detailed cross-classifications of farm structural attributes, will become available through the census. This agricultural census, and the training envisaged in the project, will add to national capacity building for planning and undertaking future agricultural census and surveys.

The low incomes derived from agriculture are the result of disadvantaged terms of trade that are rooted in the lowcompetitiveness of the output produced. While Moldovan farmers face world prices for their inputs (as most of theagricultural inputs are imported), they are not able to get world prices for their produce, particularly the high-valuehorticultural products.

Also noted positively was the establishment of health technology management to reinforce and improve the effective and efficient use of modern medical equipment to ensure best practices are observed in Moldovan maternities and neonatal intensive care units (NICU). Areas for improvement noted by the review which have been addressed in this proposal include increased emphasis on compliance of protocols and guidelines, better communication with families, enhancement of the role of the midwife, and better analysis of statistical data for managerial and political decision-making.This third and final phase of MSPP has incorporated these recommendations as well as those of colleagues and partners working in the field of perinatal health in Moldova. The proposed programme has also been developed with critical attention on future sustainability of project inputs over the years to ensure the future of our collective investments continue to bear fruit in years to come. The methodological approaches in this phase thus focus on both filling gaps identified in the review process as well as creating sustainable structures for the Moldovan perinatal health care system. Strategies for this phase focus on securing the use of evidence based medicine (EBM) (measured by standards implemented) in all maternities and NICU wards in the Republic by embedding the quality of care training portfolio within the postgraduate education programme, and by using information technologies and communication (ICT) mediums such as telemedicine and eLearning to expand access to training and information. This strategy also requires equipment maintenance systems are in place and working. Another strategy is to strengthen overall quality at facility level by fortifying hospital mangers to take on quality management at their level through their quality committees and teams. To reach the under serviced, we focus on demonstrating an approach to increase access for vulnerable communities by extending the referral system to those that currently suffer barriers to utilisation of services.This phase will continue to work to improve clinical quality of care through an expanded training programme with various modalities (within the postgraduate education programme, through telemedicine and eLearning, and practical trainings using a simulator rather than didactic trainings). Specific emphasis in this phase will be obstetric care (standards and training), essential newborn care, infection control, team approaches to strengthen collaboration between physicians and the role of the nurse and midwife in the delivery of maternal and newborn health care services. Regional and Swiss partnerships will be strengthened to be able to continue to carry out capacity building and experience sharing activities through new resource channels. And the Association for Moldovan Perinatology (AMP) will undergo a development process to help strengthen their membership base, service portfolio and their basic organizational structure to increase self sufficiency after the end of the project.To support clinical quality improvements we will work with facilities to develop a functioning health technology management (HTM) system with bioengineers in place to service the maternities and NICUs in level II and III facilities. As a co-sponsored project component HTM will be run together with REPEMOL to ensure a common agenda as we aim to work with the Ministry of Health (MoH) to ensure bioengineering has a fixed role in all level II and III hospitals. Through continued efforts in quality management (QM) at facility level, we will also focus on building functional and motivated facility level quality teams to support continuous quality improvements that benefit both clinical and hospital standards of care.Finally, evidence generated from our project and others have shown that a gap still exists in utilisation of care by the most vulnerable who account for the vast proportion of those who suffer the death or morbidity of their newborns.

However, since the adoption of the Order the progress has not been consistent in all target areas and, more importantly, the consistency of actions and the effort to integrate activities and sectoral approaches - which had been a main achievement of the 1st UNECE-SDC project - was not maintained. Thus, the need for elaboration of a concise Action Plan defining specific activities to be carried out to achieve the targets and target dates, including financial requirements (and the sources of finance) and human resources became evident. The Action Plan, which is the core output of the 2nd UNECE-SDC project titled “Implementation of targets and target dates set out in the Order of the Minister of Environment and the Minister of Health of 20 October 2010 to implement the Protocol on Water and Health in the Republic of Moldova”, would also provide a framework for overseeing the progress towards the achievement of targets and for a continuous discussion on the consistency of policies, measures and interventions in the area of water and health in the country, in close cooperation with bilateral and multilateral donors. The Action Plan on Water and Health, approved by Government, can later become part of the National Action Plan on Environment and Health.Therefore, the Republic of Moldova approached SDC and UNECE with a request to provide assistance in preparation of such an action plan.

Phase II: The overall goal of this phase will be to achieve that young men and women in Moldova (particularly those vulnerable and most at risk) adopt safer behaviours and seek assistance from health services when needed.","Phase I: The Project ""Healthy Generation - Scaling-up Youth Friendly Health Services in Moldova"" will contribute to the improvement of health and development potential of young people in Moldova by comprehensive and multidimensional interventions to support the vertical, horizontal and functional scaling up of YFHS. The present project foresees to extend the coverage with YFHS to geographic areas by integrating youth friendly approach and practices in the Reproductive Health Services (RHS), as well as in School Health Services (SHS) and at the primary health care level. Legal framework and financial mechanisms will be improved, based on costing analysis, in order to build incentives for reaching the most vulnerable young people and for quality services. Another area of improvement is the coordination of care between various levels of health services and formalizing referrals between the health systems, health units in schools, social services and NGOs. The project is in line with the national and the sector main policy documents: The National Development Strategy (NDS), The National MDGs (4th, 5th, and 6th), The National Health Policy (NHP) the Health Sector Development Strategy 2008-2017 (HSDS), the National Strategy on Reproductive Health (2005-2015) and National Youth Strategy (2009-2013) Phase II: The Project ""Healthy Generation - Scaling-up Youth Friendly Health Services in Moldova"" will contribute to the improvement of health and development potential of young people in Moldova by comprehensive and multidimensional interventions to support the vertical, horizontal and functional scaling up of YFHS. The project approach focuses on four strategic interventions. First, there will be sustained interventions to continuously improve the legal, policy and regulatory framework in order to remove legal barriers for adolescent to access YFHS and to clarify the position of YFHC within the health system. Second, the managerial and technical capacities of YFHS managers and staff will be strengthened and professionalism will be developed through networking and exposure to international experience. Third, at national and local level, inter-sectorial cooperation in adolescent health and development will be harmonised and strengthened so that existing mechanisms for inter-sectorial collaboration improve their management and referral of cases involving adolescents. Finally, social change in adolescent health and development will be achieved through communication and community mobilisation: participatory approaches in communication will place young people at the centre of all initiatives aiming at improving their well-being. A particular emphasis will be placed on mobilising a wide variety of actors at the community level and in using a wide range of information sources and communication technologies to better reach all young people, with a particular focus on young people most at risk and especially vulnerable adolescents.",01/06/2011,31/10/2018,Grant,120 - HEALTH,0,0,0,731571,709972,0,3940498.881,0,5382041.881Switzerland,SMALL ACTIONS - SWITZERLAND,"To support efficient and effective the organization of events and activities by institutions, organizations and NGOs of the Republic of Moldova.","The Cooperation Office is in charge of the implementation of the programme and its projects, according to its annual programme.

ENGLISH: The specific objective is to improve, through a regional approach, the quality of refugee status. These objectives directly support the goals of various asylum and migration-related processes of relevance to the European Union and the target countries: First, the Prague Process, launched at a Ministerial Conference in 2009, promotes migration partnerships among the participating states of the European Union, as well as the target countries and other states. Participating states endorsed a joint declaration on ""Building Migration Partnerships."" In November 2011, a ""Prague Process Action Plan"" was adopted in order to translate this declaration into concrete action. The objectives of this Project correspond to the specific actions 1-3 of Chapter VI - ""Strengthening capacities in the area of asylum and international protection"" of the Prague Process Action Plan 2012-2016, including: 1. In collaboration with UNHCR, to assist the Parties in developing and strengthening their asylum systems, including national asylum legislation, to ensure compliance with international standards. 2. To support asylum authorities of the Parties in: 1. strengthening reception capacities for people in need of international protection, 2. strengthening their capacities in gathering and analysing information on asylum seekers' countries of origin in the context of the overall strengthening of asylum systems 3. To promote the development of training programmes for law enforcement bodies and the judiciary on international protection standards and on the principle of non-refoulement [emphasis added]. Second, the Stockholm Programme, adopted at the European Council of 4 December 2009, underlines the importance of the EU's engagement with third countries in the area of asylum and migration, including through capacity-building and other forms of support. Third, European Asylum Support Office (EASO), which became fully functional in June 2011, is tasked to strengthen European Union (EU) countries' practical cooperation on asylum, to support EU countries whose asylum and reception systems are under particular pressure and to enhance the implementation of the Common European Asylum System (CEAS). The external dimension is an important part of the work of EASO. The Global Approach to Migration provides the framework for the external dimension of a common asylum policy and for cooperation with regions of origin, transit and return in cooperation with UNHCR and the European Commission. EASO's work concerning the External Dimension will concern at least the following areas: - Promoting and assisting capacity building in third countries' own asylum and reception systems. - Protection in the region; implementing Regional Protection Programs (RPP's), together with the European Commission, UNHCR and other partners in the field [emphasis added]. For 2012, EASO's activities under the external dimension are limited to the development of a work plan; however, for the period of implementation of this project (2013-2014), EASO has committed to being an associate in the project. This will ensure application of their standards and methodology for relevant activities included in the Action. Fourth, the Eastern Partnership's Platform on Democracy, Good Governance and Stability, through the Panel on Migration and Asylum, aims to strengthen asylum and migration systems in line with best practice. According to the goals set forth by the Eastern Partnership in its recently released roadmap, by autumn 2013, in asylum matters, legislation would have been introduced and administrative structures and procedures set up, ensuring effective protection. Such improvements should be achieved through a dialogue on such issues between the Eastern partners and the EU, as well as between Eastern partners themselves. Fifth, the EU-Russia High Level Dialogue on Asylum and Migration at its session in Moscow December 2011 has featured UNHCR and EASO cooperation, and inter alia pointed to the EAC as a potential means of pursuing the sharing of expertise","Ac_iunea se bazeaz_ pe vasta experien__ a UNHCR în ini_ierea _i sus_inerea sistemelor de asigurare a calit__ii in domeniul azilului, inclusiv implementarea a dou_ proiecte cu participarea mai multor __ri din UE, care au fost par_ial finan_ata din fondurile europene pentru refugia_i (FER).

Cu toate acestea, în 2009-2011 doar la trei solicitanti de azil (prima cerere) li s-au acordat statutul de refugiat (57 de persoane au primit protec_ie complementar_).

Moldova poate împ_rt__i din experien_a recent_ de stabilirea a sistemului de azil, în timp ce ea mai lucreaz_ la consolidarea calit__ii DSR. Punctele slabe ale adjudecare a azilului în regiune depind de mai mul_i factori: • Procedurile de determinare a statutului de refugiat nu sunt suficient de standardizate. Autorit__ile din regiune au elaborat regulamente interne a procedurii de înregistrare si DSR. • ofi_erii de eligibilitate nu primesc instruire sistematic_ _i, astfel, lipsa de cuno_tin_e, instrumente _i angajament profesional, lipsa statutului; • ofi_erii de eligibilitate sunt au varii pregatiri profesionale, astfel deciziile lor duc lipsa de argumentare, claritate obiectiv_ _i prezentare; • Foarte pu_ini ofi_eri de eligibilitate în_eleg limba englez_, ceea ce creeaz_ probleme suplimentare pentru consolidarea capacit__ii profesionale _i oportunitati de schimb interna_ional • reorganiz_ri periodice ale autorit__ilor din domeniul azilului _i schimbarea frecventa a ofiterilor de eligibilitate; • materiale importante de instruire, jurispruden_a CEDO _i literatur_ legate de adjudecare a cererilor de azil nu sunt disponibile în limbile na _ionale sau în limba rus_; • informa_ii privind _ara de origine în limbile nationale _i limb_ rus_, este dificil de a c_uta _i de accesa; • ofi_erii de eligibilitate nu au schimburi de experien__ sistematice cu al _i profesioni_ti, în special din Europa Central_ _i de Vest; • Autorit__ile de azil nu au unit__i de asigurare a calit__ii _i mecanisme de evaluare, astfel încât diferen_ele nu sunt identificate _i abordate în timp util; • Judec_torii au o expunere limitat_ la dreptul interna_ional al refugia_ ilor; • experien__ juridic_ post-sovietica in regiunii creeaz_ un set de provoc_ri în aplicarea unor concepte juridice comune în dreptul de azil (de exemplu, evaluarea anticipativa a riscului, utilizarea de informa_ii _ara de origine ca dovad_, sarcina probei, credibilitate, beneficiul dubiului). This Action will support the quality of asylum adjudication in 6 Eastern European states: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine (“target countries”). The Russian Federation will be invited as an observer to regional events and meetings but not participate in other activities. The Action will involve the assistance of the asylum authorities of a pool of EU member states, including potentially Poland, Romania, Germany, Sweden and the UK, who will provide good practice advice, including their own experience with quality assurance in the asylum procedure. The European Asylum Support Office (EASO) will closely cooperate with UNHCR under this Action. The Action builds on UNHCR extensive experience in initiating and supporting asylum quality assurance systems, including under two multi-country Actions in the EU, which were partially financed under the European Refugee Funds (ERF). The methodology of this Action was developed on the basis of a review of the activities and results achieved under these two Actions. The young asylum systems in the Eastern European countries have generally low rates of granting international protection, and wide disparities exist in terms of rates of protection for applicants from various refugee-producing countries. Moldova is aiming at eventual EU membership and has made significant progress in bringing its asylum legislation in line with the relevant EU Directives. However, in 2009-2011 only three first-time applicants were granted refugee status (57 persons were granted complementary protection). The quality of refugee status determination (RSD) varies. Quality assurance mechanisms need to be further improved to render its system sustainable and independent from UNHCR's monitoring of individual decisions. Moldova can share its recent asylum building experience while working itself towards the consolidation of a quality assurance structure. The weaknesses of asylum adjudication in the region stem from several factors: * Procedures for refugee status determination procedures are insufficiently standardized. Authorities in the region have developed little internal guidance to structure the procedure from registration to determination. * Eligibility officers do not receive systematic training and thus lack knowledge, tools and professional engagement and status; * Eligibility officers are of various professional backgrounds, thus reasoning of decisions lacks objective and well-presented argumentation and clarity; * Very few eligibility officers understand English, which creates additional challenges for effective capacity building and international exchange * Regular reorganizations of asylum authorities and high turnover of eligibility staff; * Important training materials, ECHR jurisprudence, and literature related to adjudication of asylum applications are not available in national languages or in Russian; * Country-of-origin information in relevant languages—including, and importantly, the Russian language—is difficult to search and access; * Eligibility officers do not systematically exchange experiences with other professionals, particularly from Central and Western Europe; * Asylum authorities do not have quality assurance units and mechanisms, so gaps are not identified and addressed in a timely manner; * Judges have limited exposure to international refugee law; The region’s post-Soviet legal experience creates a set of challenges in applying some legal concepts common in asylum law (e.g., forward-looking assessment of risk, use of country-of-origin information as evidence, burden of proof, credibility, benefit of the doubt).",01/02/2013,30/06/2015,Grant,150 - GOVERNMENT AND CIVIL SOCIETY,0,0,0,0,0,203835.105,0,0,203835.105United Nations,Support for adaptation and implementation of Integrated Pest Management in Moldova.,Support the development and implementation of national programmes on adaptation and promotion of integrated pest management.,The project will strengthen the capacities of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry (MAFI) and Phytosanitary Service of the National Food Safety Agency (ANSA) to develop a national programme for adaptation of integrated pest management.,01/01/2015,31/12/2016,Grant,311 - AGRICULTURE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,343726.982,343726.982United Nations,Development of the National Strategy and Action Plan for animal genetic resources and dairy cattle genetic improvement programme.,Improvement of genetic resources in the livestock sector of Moldova,"The project will contribute to re-establishment of the performance system which helps to build a knowledge base such as baseline animal performance, best production practices, best breeding strategies.",01/01/2015,31/10/2016,Grant,311 - AGRICULTURE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,261887.224,261887.224United Nations,RURAL FINANCIAL SERVICES AND AGRIBUSINESS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (RFSADP) - IFAD 5,"THE OVERALL GOAL of the RFSADP is reduction of income poverty and malnutrition among poor rural people in Moldova.( to sustainably improve the assets and incomes of about 37,000 poor rural Moldovan beneficiaries).","The Project would contribute to establishing pro-poor market linkages for the rural poor through support for competitive commodity value chains, including market research and development, business development services and producer associations; and achieving international quality standards in production, processing and packaging; and promoting access to a full range of appropriate and mainstreamed financial services, with a particular emphasis on products that support the development of sustainably improved incomes for the most vulnerable and poorest groups in rural areas.",04/07/2011,03/07/2016," - Grant - Soft Loan",311 - AGRICULTURE,0,0,0,12720000,0,0,0,0,12720000United Nations,SUPPORT TO CONFIDENCE BUILDING MEASURES II,"The overall objective of the programme is to facilitate the settlement of the Transnistrian issue through ensuring economic and social development of local communities and increasing confidence between both banks of the Nistru River by involving local authorities, civil society organizations, business community and other stakeholders.","The overall objective of the programme is to contribute to confidence building between both banks of the Nistru River by involving local authorities, civil society organisations, business community and other stakeholders, as well as through ensuring economic and social development of local communities.
